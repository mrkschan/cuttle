# List of rate limit zones identified by their 'host' field.
# 'Host' header of the HTTP request is matched with each of these 'host' fields.
# Rate limit control of the first matched zone in the list will be applied to
# the HTTP request.
zones:
  - host: "*"  # Apply to requests forwarded to all domains.
    shared: true  # The rate limit is shared by all domains.
    control: rpns  # Use request-per-second rate limit control.
    rate: 1  # At most 1 requests per N second in the entire zone.
    nseconds: 3 # N second = 3

# Example - Only throttle *.github.com and no rate limit on other domains.
#
# zones:
# - host: "*.github.com"  # Apply to requests forwarded to all sub-domains of github.com.
#   shared: false  # The rate limit is applied to each sub-domain of github.com separately.
#   control: rps  # Use request-per-second rate limit control.
#   rate: 3  # At most 3 requests per second forwarded per each sub-domain.
# - host: "*"  # Apply to all requests forwarded to non- github.com.
#   control: noop  # Use no-op control, i.e., no rate limit.
#
# NOTE: Default value of 'shared' is false.
# NOTE: 'rate' is not required for noop control.


# Example - Throttle requests by URL path under github.com.
#
# zones:
# - host: "github.com"
#   path: "/*"  # Apply to requests under github.com/, including '/'.
#   limitby: "path"  # Limit requests by URL path, instead of host.
#   shared: true  # The rate limit is applied to all URL paths.
#   control: rps  # Use request-per-second rate limit control.
#   rate: 2  # At most 2 requests per second forwarded per URL path.
# - host: "api.github.com"
#   path: "/users/*"  # Apply to requests under api.github.com/users/, including '/users/'.
#   limitby: "path"  # Limit requests by URL path, instead of host.
#   shared: false  # The rate limit is applied to each URL path separately.
#   control: rps  # Use request-per-second rate limit control.
#   rate: 2  # At most 2 requests per second forwarded.
# - host: "*"  # Apply to all other requests.
#   control: ban  # Use ban control, i.e., no request forwarded.
#
# NOTE: Wildcard '*' can only be applied to the field specified in 'limitby'.
# NOTE: Default value of 'path' is '/'.
# NOTE: Default value of 'limitby' is 'host'.
